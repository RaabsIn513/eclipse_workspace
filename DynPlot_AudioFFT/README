A Dynamic bar plot hooked up to an object that passes bytes read from the microphone and applies the FFT (GoogleDocs below)

continuously reads 2048 @ 16kHz bytes from the microphone. Note use of notifyObserver(b) function that triggers the graph to update. 

This setup (with more tweaking) shows the best promise of our debug interface.

Known Issues:

> No stop/start buttons
> X, Y labels incorrect.
